# Troubleshooting

Common issues that you may run into when configuring or running Laravel Doctrine.

## The DatabaseTransactions trait is not working for tests

You will need to use a new trait instead of the default Laravel trait. Here is an example of an implementation:

```
<?php

namespace Tests;

use LaravelDoctrine\ORM\Facades\EntityManager;

trait DoctrineDatabaseTransactions
{
    public function setUpDoctrineDatabaseTransactions(): void
    {
        EntityManager::getConnection()->beginTransaction();
    }

    public function tearDownDoctrineDatabaseTransactions(): void
    {
        EntityManager::getConnection()->rollBack();
    }
}
```

If you would like to also use `assertDatabaseHas` in your tests, you need to tell Laravel to use the same connection as Doctrine is using so that it can find rows that have not been committed in a transaction:

```
$pdo = app()->make(\Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface::class)->getConnection()
            ->getWrappedConnection();

app()->make(\Illuminate\Database\ConnectionInterface::class)->setPdo($pdo);
```

## ErrorException: require(.../storage/proxies/__CG__Entity.php): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory

Proxies need to be generated before they can be used. You can generate the proxies manually using the `php artisan doctrine:generate:proxies` command, or you can enable proxy auto generation in your `doctrine.php` config file. By default, you can set the `DOCTRINE_PROXY_AUTOGENERATE` environment value to true to enable auto generation.

Note: Proxy auto generation should always be disabled in production for performance reasons.
