# Permissions

Both User and Role can have permissions. 
To add this behaviour we can simply add the `LaravelDoctrine\ACL\Contracts\HasPermissions` interface to them.
We can also add the `LaravelDoctrine\ACL\Permissions\HasPermissions` trait to have some nice helpers. 
We can use the `@ACL\HasPermissions` annotations to define the permissions relation.

```php
<?php

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use LaravelDoctrine\ACL\Mappings as ACL;
use LaravelDoctrine\ACL\Contracts\HasPermissions as HasPermissionContract;

class User implements HasPermissionContract 
{
    use HasPermissions;
    
    /**
     * @ACL\HasPermissions
     */
     public $permissions;
}
```

### Getting all permissions

You can get a list of all permissions with the `LaravelDoctrine\ACL\Permissions\PermissionManager`

```php
$manager->getAllPermissions();
```

### Config Permissions

By setting the permissions driver to `config`, no additional `permissions` table will be created, but permissions will be expected to be added inside the config: `acl.permissions.list` The given permissions wil now be stored in the Entity as json.

```php
<?php 

return [
    'permissions' => [
        'driver' => 'config',
        'list' => [
            'create.posts'
        ]
    ]
];
```

### Database Permissions

By setting the permissions driver to `doctrine`, an additional `permissions` table will be created. Permissions will be stored in Pivot tables for roles and users. A default `Permission` entity is included in this package. 
You can replace that one by your own inside the config as long as it implements the ` LaravelDoctrine\ACL\Contracts\Permission` interface.

### Checking if a User or Role has permission

#### On the User or Role entity

When adding the `LaravelDoctrine\ACL\Permissions\HasPermissions` you will get a `hasPermissionTo` method.
First the `User` entity will check if it has the right permission itself. If not it will search in its roles. If none of them has permission, it will return false.

```php
$user->hasPermissionTo('create.posts');
$role->hasPermissionTo('create.posts');
```

#### Using the Gate helper

All permissions are automatically defined inside Laravel's Gate helper.
 
 ```php
 Gate::allows('create.posts');
 @can('create.posts');
 $user->can('create.posts');
 ```
