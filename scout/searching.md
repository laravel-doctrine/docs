# Searching

You may begin searching an entity using the `search` method. 
The search method accepts a single string that will be used to search your models. 
You should then chain the `get` method onto the search query to retrieve the hydrated Doctrine Entities that match the given search query:

```php
$posts = $repository->search('Star Trek')->get();
```

You can find the other usages in the Laravel Scout docs: https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/scout
